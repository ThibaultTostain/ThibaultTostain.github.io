								<p>Cyclists are constantly on the lookout for ways to improve their performance, and

							portfolio.
							</br>The sensors also had to be held securely on the bike frame. For speed, we use a
							hall-effect sensor and magnets on the wheel, so I made a small case to hold the sensor
							without damaging the bike, touching the wheel or moving in the event of an impact. For the
							safety aspect, we opted to take a cycling jacket and put LEDs inside to indicate whether the
							cyclist was braking or turning to one side or the other. All this with a connector that also
							uses magnets and an end-piece that I also made to allow you to get off the bike without
							ripping out the cables. You can find the archive of this project on <a
